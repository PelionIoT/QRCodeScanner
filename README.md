# QRCodeScanner
Program that allows the user to scan the QR code on the product and generate a label with the owners information which is found in an Excel file.

Going forward, I'll make this file edit the same JSON file as the Random Number Assigner program instead of putting it directly into Excel. 

I'll make a separate program for exporting the useful information in the JSON file to an Excel file. 
This way the finance department can use Excel Pivot Tabels to analyze different aspects of the products, and get
data like what regions are buying what products, etc.
